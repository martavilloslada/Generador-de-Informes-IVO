My name is Michael Rada and I am the founder and the Father of INDUSTRY 5.0, which was born on December 1st, 2015 (https://medium.com/@michael.rada/industry-5-0-definition-6a2f9922dc48). 

I m confused why you used the name of INDUSTRY 5.0 if the content of your webinar doe does not reveal any speaker to talk about this topic, but maybe it was just a mistake and mistakes happen,

If you would like to talk INDUSTRY 5.0 next time feel free to contact me, I can deliver the experience and point of founders view on five years of implementation in real business environment., you can even learn more from the INDUSTRY 5.0 KEYNOTE SPEECH - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4BFPvJ9LWw

I am looking forward to our cooperation
