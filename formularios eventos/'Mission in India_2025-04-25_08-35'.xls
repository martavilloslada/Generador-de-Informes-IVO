I\'ve heard of your traid fair through the Impact Hub network (Berlin, Germany). I\'d be highy interested in representing my company and our products, in case there is still a travel grant for a SME available.
At Cupex we\'ve developed multiple innovative lids for beverage cups and a cup, too. We\'ve finished our pilot-series of our reusable lids and have ordered the injection moulding machines for mass production, which should start in a few weeks. We\'re also in the final stages of development of our single-use lid which is entirely made of fibre material/paper. For this we\'re also part of a Indo-German research and development cluster in order to produce these lids from banana tree fibres. Both of our lids, the reusable lid made from polypropylene and the single-use lid made from fibre materials are highly interesting for the Indian market, because of the Indian ban of single-use plastics.
Our lids all have a big drinking-hole that allows a natural flow of the beverage as opposed to the small drinking slot that is the current industry standard and often leads to burnt lips and spillage. Our lids are all reclosable to prevent spillage and to keep wasps etc. from entering the cup. This is also true for our single-use fibre-based lid, which makes it the world\'s first reclosable fibre-based lid.
We\'re currently starting our sales process and will be looking to scale sales globally. We\'re also constantly looking for new materials to be as sustainable as possible and production partners, especially for our fibre-based lid.

Would you reckon our company and products to be a good fit for this traid fair? I\'d be happy to hear back from you.

Best wishes,
Marvin Thar</td> <td>--</td> <td>02/06/22</td> <td>46533</td> </tr> </table> <script>window.opener.postMessage('complete', '*');</script>
